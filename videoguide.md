3. **Test POST**: Click "POST /api/v1/menuItems" ‚Üí Add JSON:
```json
{
  "name": "Cappuccino",
  "description": "Rich espresso with steamed milk foam",
  "price": 4.50,
  "category": "Beverages"
}
```
4. **Test PUT**: Update the created item
5. **Test DELETE**: Remove the item

**What to Say for Swagger Testing**:
"Let me demonstrate API testing through the Swagger interface. First, I'll test the GET endpoint to retrieve all menu items. Now I'll create a new item by posting this JSON data - notice how Swagger shows the request format and validates the response. I can also test PUT for updates and DELETE for removal, all with immediate feedback."

**Method 2: Terminal cURL Commands**
```bash
# GET request
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/menuItems"

# POST request  
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/menuItems" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Latte","price":4.25,"category":"Beverages"}'

# PUT request
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/menuItems/1" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"price":4.75}'

# DELETE request
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/menuItems/1"
```

**What to Say for Terminal Testing**:
"I can also test the API using terminal commands with cURL. This demonstrates that the API works with any HTTP client, not just the browser interface.
